Christmas Project and for the JLCPCB contest

It is a christmas tree with a holder that you can break of the pcb.
The ic on this pcb is designed the way, that they look like they were presents under the.

On the backside of the tree there will be mounted some reverse RGB LEDs that are controlled by a RGB driver over i2c.

I made this for some friends and familymember as a gift.

You can view some pictures of the pcb if you open schematics.pdf. I didnt received the pcb yet.
